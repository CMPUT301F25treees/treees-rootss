# Dodo Lottery Application for Android

## Overview
This Android app, developed in Android Studio, allows community centers to manage event registration through a fair lottery process. 
Instead of rewarding first-come-first-served signups, the system allows participants to join the waiting list during registration.
This ensures fairness and accessibility, especially for users facing scheduling or physical limitations.

It allows three primary user roles:
- **Entrants** – browse, join, and review events
- **Organizers** – create, manage, and notify participants
- **Admins** – moderate events, users, and logs

Core features of this app:
- **Lottery-based event selection** for fair participant enrollment  
- **QR code scanning** to view and join event waiting lists instantly  
- **Firebase integration** for real-time data storage and updates  
- **Image upload** for event posters  
- **Role-based access control** for entrants, organizers, and admins  
- **Map** geolocation verification for fair local signups
